![Our seal, an temporary desgin!](/img/seal.jpg "Seal of Ben and Leo")


## 元素 | Elements
纹章为圆形，主要由中式传统元素构成。

上部左边是太阳，右部是弯月。日月中间是中式的祥云。日月从大海中共同升起，中式的海浪纹被用以表现海。这种海浪纹形式在日式浮世绘风格中也有体现。

下部是一头狮子，背上驮着火焰。

This is a circular seal composed of traditional chinese elements.

On the top left is the sun, and the top right is the moon (first quarter). The sun and the mmoon rise together from the sea, which is represented by traditional Chinese wave pattern. You may find the pattern familiar in Ukiyo-e paintings.

On the bottom is a lion with flames on its back.


## 意义 | Interpretations

为什么纹章中要包含日、月、海、狮子、火焰这些元素呢？

这要从我们的名字说起。我的名字中有"海"和“明”，而明字左边是日，右边是月，所以从海中共同升起的太阳和月亮代表了“海明”。

Leo的名字中有“浩”，“浩”的本义是指水势浩大。所以纹章中大的海浪纹是对“浩”的表现。Leo的名字中有“然”，其本义为火焰、烧、将猎获的动物烤熟了吃。狮子背上的火焰是对“然”的表现。Leo在拉丁语中是狮子的含义，它也是黄道十二宫中狮子座的名称，狮子座群星像一头卧狮。纹章中的狮子是对“Leo”的表现。

Why the seal contains elements of the sun, the moon, sea, lion and flames?

They all trace back to our names. In my chinese name, there are characters "海" and "明"。For "明", the left side is "日"，which means the sun; and the right side is "月"，which means the moon. Thus the rising sun and moon from the sea is a representation of my name "海明"。

Leo's chinese name has character "浩". "浩" in chinese means great water that produces huge sounds. The big waves in seal is to represent this. Leo's chinese name also has character "然"，which means flames, burning, roasting harvest animal. The flame on lion's back is to represent this. Leo is name of 5th constellations of the zodiac, and its name is Latin for lion and depicts a crouching lion of the constellation. The lion in the seal is to represent "Leo".


## 设计 | Desgin

纹章是使用ipad procreate apple pencil 手绘完成。祥云纹和海浪纹都是传统中式纹样。狮子和火焰借鉴了中国化的佛像。

The seal is created using ipad procreate with apple pencil. The cloud and wave patterns are traditional Chinese. The lion and the flames are borrowed and modified from Buddhism in Chinese culture.
