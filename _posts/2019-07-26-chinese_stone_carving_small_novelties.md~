篆刻是中国的一项传统艺术，也深刻影响了中华文化圈的其他国家。

"Seal carving, also seal cutting, or zhuanke in Chinese (篆刻), is a traditional form of art that originated in China and later spread to East Asia. It refers to cutting a design into the bottom face of the seal (the active surface used for stamping, rather than the sides or top). Also known as seal engraving."

传统上，篆刻的内容是篆书文字，位于石章的底部，而石章的侧面则有题跋。但事实上，任意的底线画都有可能成为篆刻的题材，下面就是我的游戏之作。

In tradition, the contents of seal carving are personal names or facility names or sometimes poets on the bottom of the stone seal. While on the side of the stone, postscript are carved.
Here I have several very untraditional works. Hope them amuse you.

侧面的题跋，“笑将红绣遮红烛，不教才郎夜看书”，源自“阳春曲·题情”

postscript on the side of seal. It writes "with a smile, she covers the candle light with her sleeves in red, and stops the young man from readding books".

像不像外星人？长长的四肢，有没有让你想起[飞天小女警](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%A3%9B%E5%A4%A9%E5%B0%8F%E5%A5%B3%E8%AD%A6)？

Does the figure looks like an alien? Or！Does it remind you of [the powerpuff girls] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Powerpuff_Girls)?
